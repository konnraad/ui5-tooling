# Troubleshooting
## UI5 Server
### Chrome Redirects HTTP URLs to HTTPS (`ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR`)
An HTTPS server or proxy that was previously running on a domain (e.g. `localhost`), might have set an HSTS header, enforcing Chrome to always use HTTPS for this domain. See https://www.chromium.org/hsts. This makes it impossible to connect to an HTTP-only server running on the same domain.

#### Resolution
You need to delete the HSTS mapping in [chrome://net-internals/#hsts](chrome://net-internals/#hsts) by entering the domain name (e.g. `localhost`) and pressing "delete".

## UI5 Project
### `~/.ui5` Taking too Much Disk Space

There are possibly many versions of UI5 framework dependencies installed on your system, taking a large amount of disk space.

#### Resolution

Remove the `.ui5/framework/` directory from your user's home directory:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.ui5/framework/
```

Any missing framework dependencies will be downloaded again during the next UI5 Tooling invocation.

## Environment Variables
### Changing the Log Level

In CI environments or in a combination with other tools, the usage of [UI5 CLI's `--log-level`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/stable/pages/CLI/#common-options) command parameter might be inconvenient and even impossible.

#### Resolution

Replace UI5 Tooling's `--log-level` option with the `UI5_LOG_LVL` environment variable.

Example:

`UI5_LOG_LVL=silly ui5 build`

On Windows:

`set UI5_LOG_LVL=silly ui5 build`

Cross Environment via [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env):

`cross-env UI5_LOG_LVL=silly ui5 build`

UI5 + Karma:

`cross-env UI5_LOG_LVL=verbose npm run karma`


::: warning
The combination of the `UI5_LOG_LVL` environment variable with the `--log-level` CLI parameter might lead to unexpected results; they should be used interchangeably but not together. The CLI parameter takes precedence over the `UI5_LOG_LVL` environment variable.
:::
### Changing UI5 Tooling's Data Directory

UI5 Tooling's data directory is by default at `~/.ui5`. It's the place where the framework artifacts are stored.
In some cases and environments this is not a convenient location and the user needs to provide a better one.

The path to it can either be provided via environment variable or permanently set in the configuration.

::: tip Info
Paths are resolved relative to the current root project path (i.e. where the package.json is located).
:::
#### Environment variable  `UI5_DATA_DIR`

Unix:
```sh
UI5_DATA_DIR=/my/custom/location/.ui5 ui5 build
```

Windows:
```sh
set UI5_DATA_DIR="C:\\my\\custom\\location\\.ui5" ui5 build
```

#### Configuration `ui5DataDir`

Configure a custom directory:
```sh
ui5 config set ui5DataDir /my/custom/location/.ui5
```

Unset the configuration to switch back to the default directory:
```sh
ui5 config set ui5DataDir
```
